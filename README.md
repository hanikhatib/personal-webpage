## Featured Projects

### Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs)
Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) use AI to reconstruct 3D scenes from a limited number of images by predicting light and depth information at each point in space. This enables photorealistic scene rendering from new perspectives, even with sparse image inputs. Below are some of my NeRF projects:

1. **Lake NeRF (Drone Perspective)**
   - *Description:* Generated a NeRF of a lake using 180 images captured from a drone.
   - *Link:* [View Project](https://x.com/hani_khatib_/status/1542843324859564034)

2. **Remote Control Truck NeRF**
   - *Description:* Created a NeRF rendering of an RC truck using 150 images.
   - *Link:* [View Project](https://x.com/hani_khatib_/status/1541132363572338689)

3. **Refurbished 2006 Ford Mustang GT NeRF**
   - *Description:* Generated a NeRF rendering of a refurbished 2006 Ford Mustang GT.
   - *Link:* [View Project](https://x.com/hani_khatib_/status/1551331458110857217)

4. **Toronto Graffiti Alley NeRF**
   - *Description:* Reconstructed a Toronto graffiti alley scene using NeRF.
   - *Link:* [View Project](https://x.com/hani_khatib_/status/1540924718030770188)

### geneDRAGNN: Gene Disease Prioritization using Graph Neural Networks
- *Description:* As part of an undergraduate research team, developed geneDRAGNN, a methodology leveraging graph neural networks for predicting gene-disease associations. This work was recognized with the Best Student Paper Award at the IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, and previously won a $25,000 prize in the ProjectX 2021 undergraduate Machine Learning Competition.
- *Paper:* [IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9863043)
- *Code Repository:* [GitHub](https://github.com/geneDRAGNN/geneDRAGNN)
- *Competition Details:* [ProjectX 2021](https://www.projectx2020.com/projectx-2021)
